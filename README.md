This game is basically a text based Card Gmae made entirely on C 
It started out a game having cards with their attacks n mana Cost And 2 Players who will be assigned those cards Randomly 
But as time progressed we saw the potential to make this game go on another Level 
We implemented a Bot Rather than 2 Plyers 
Added story Line 
Added Spells
now adding spells was a chellenge As speels are entirely function so to add them in structs and make a dynamic Function Array We had to Boggle our Minds 
but we achieved it
now u Can choose your main Element
progress through the story 
as after each level u can unlock new Cards and spells
with the Help of Dynamic Memory allocation
AT first i tried using Realloc but it Always gave Garbage value 
So to get rid of this problem i used a shortcut and made the initial card struct array of size 10 rather the reallocating
well thats basically the whole Game
